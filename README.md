LUNA16: LUng Nodule Analysis 2016
https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/

We excluded scans with a slice thickness greater than 2.5 mm. In total, 888 CT scans are included (843 training - 45 validation)
The data contains annotations which were collected during a two-phase annotation process using 4 experienced radiologists
Each radiologist marked lesions they identified as non-nodule, nodule < 3 mm, and nodules >= 3 mm.
The reference standard of our challenge consists of all nodules >= 3 mm accepted by at least 3 out of 4 radiologists.

(0020, 1041) Slice Location                      DS: '-69.5' is <imageZposition>-69.5</imageZposition> in the xml file
